- 👋 Hi, I’m @Teatime-Partner, also known as Dagmara! Throughout my career I have filled many roles - I've finished university as Microbiologist and Science Teacher, have been an Administrator, Customer Service Assistand and Customs Broker. I'm currently changing my career, and learning a lot about Web Development and IT sector in general. It is something I've always apsired to do, and the enouragement from my friends and a lot of YT videos (big shout-out to PirateSowtware and Thor for hacking the algorithm and giving me the extra push to make things).
  
- 👀 I’m interested in many things! From technical standpoint I'm very invested in Wed Dev and UI/UX, but my hobbies include crochet, games and TEA. My first ever web page was created when I was 10 years old, on a very used school PC using some basic paint to create the design and CMTools to push them to display on the page. Great times! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fullstack development, which includes Javascript and MERN stack, but I'm slowly branching towards WordPress Dev as it looks like a really interesting avenue to explore. PHP, SQL, and Doker are great skills to have, after alL!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, both front-end and back-end. While I don't have much experience with back-end yet, it's a grat opportunity for me to learn in the great community.
